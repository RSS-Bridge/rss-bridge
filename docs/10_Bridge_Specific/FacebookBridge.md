FacebookBridge
===============
State of this bridge:
- Facebook Groups (and probably other sections too) do not work at all
- No maintainer
- Needs cookie consent support for public pages
- Needs login support see [this example](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/issues/1891) for Instagram) for private groups

Due to the 2020 [Facebook redesign](https://engineering.fb.com/2020/05/08/web/facebook-redesign/)
and the requirement to [accept cookies](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/348535683460989)
users are getting [problems with Facebook on public RSS-Bridge instances](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/issues/2047).
