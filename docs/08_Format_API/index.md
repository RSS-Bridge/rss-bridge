A _Format_ is an class that allows **RSS-Bridge** to turn items from a bridge into an RSS-feed format. It is developed in a PHP file located in the `formats/` folder (see [Folder structure](../04_For_Developers/03_Folder_structure.md)) and either implements the [FormatInterface](../08_Format_API/02_FormatInterface.md) interface or extends the [FormatAbstract](../08_Format_API/03_FormatAbstract.md) class.
