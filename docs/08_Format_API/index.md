A Format is a class that allows RSS-Bridge to turn items from a bridge into an RSS-feed format.
It is developed in a PHP file located in the `formats/` folder
[Folder structure](../04_For_Developers/03_Folder_structure.md)
and either implements the
[FormatInterface](../08_Format_API/02_FormatInterface.md)
interface or extends the FormatAbstract class.
