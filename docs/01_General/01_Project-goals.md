**RSS-Bridge** aims at sites that:

  - don't provide public accessible Atom or RSS feeds
  - force their users to subscribe to e-mail notifications
  - force their users to use their own proprietary APIs
  - require their users to come back on a regular basis in order to check for new content

**RSS-Bridge** will generate feeds based on "bridges" that are developed for any site. Those bridges will collect data and extract all necessary information which is then converted into various feed formats like Atom or RSS.
