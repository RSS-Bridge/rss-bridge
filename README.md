Latest zip as of Sep 2023: https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/archive/refs/tags/2023-09-24.zip

### How to install on Debian 12 (nginx + php-fpm)

These instructions have been tested on a fresh Debian 12 VM from Digital Ocean (1vcpu-512mb-10gb, 5 USD/month).

```shell
timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Oslo

apt install git nginx php8.2-fpm php-mbstring php-simplexml php-curl php-intl

# Create a new user account
useradd --shell /bin/bash --create-home rss-bridge

cd /var/www

# Create folder and change ownership
mkdir rss-bridge && chown rss-bridge:rss-bridge rss-bridge/

# Become user
su rss-bridge

# Fetch latest master
git clone https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge.git rss-bridge/
cd rss-bridge

# Copy over the default config
cp -v config.default.ini.php config.ini.php

# Give full permissions only to owner (rss-bridge)
chmod 700 -R ./

# Give read and execute to others (nginx and php-fpm)
chmod o+rx ./ ./static

# Give read to others (nginx)
chmod o+r -R ./static
```

Nginx config:

```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/rss-bridge.conf

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/rss-bridge.access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/rss-bridge.error.log;
    log_not_found off;

    # Intentionally not setting a root folder here

    # autoindex is off by default but feels good to explicitly turn off
    autoindex off;

    # Static content only served here
    location /static/ {
        alias /var/www/rss-bridge/static/;
    }

    # Pass off to php-fpm when location is exactly /
    location = / {
        root /var/www/rss-bridge/;
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 45s;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/rss-bridge.sock;
    }

    # Reduce spam
    location = /favicon.ico {
        access_log off;
    }

    # Reduce spam
    location = /robots.txt {
        access_log off;
    }
}
```

PHP FPM pool config:
```ini
; /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/rss-bridge.conf

[rss-bridge]

user = rss-bridge
group = rss-bridge

listen = /run/php/rss-bridge.sock

listen.owner = www-data
listen.group = www-data

pm = static
pm.max_children = 10
pm.max_requests = 500
```

PHP ini config:
```ini
; /etc/php/8.2/fpm/conf.d/30-rss-bridge.ini

max_execution_time = 15
memory_limit = 64M

## How-to

### How to fix "Access denied."

Output is from php-fpm. It is unable to read index.php.

    chown rss-bridge:rss-bridge /var/www/rss-bridge/index.php

### How to password-protect the instance (token)

Modify `config.ini.php`:

    [authentication]

    token = "hunter2"

### How to remove all cache items

As current user:

    bin/cache-clear

As user rss-bridge:

    sudo -u rss-bridge bin/cache-clear

As root:

    sudo bin/cache-clear

### How to remove all expired cache items

    bin/cache-prune

### How to fix "PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Exception: The FileCache path is not writable"

# Or, give everyone write permission
chmod 777 -R /var/www/rss-bridge/cache

# Or last ditch effort (CAREFUL)

### How to fix "attempt to write a readonly database"

The sqlite files (db, wal and shm) are not writeable.

    chown -v rss-bridge:rss-bridge cache/*

### How to fix "Unable to prepare statement: 1, no such table: storage"

    rm cache/*

### How to create a new bridge from scratch

Create the new bridge in e.g. `bridges/BearBlogBridge.php`:

```php
<?php

class BearBlogBridge extends BridgeAbstract
{
    const NAME = 'BearBlog (bearblog.dev)';

    public function collectData()
    {
        $dom = getSimpleHTMLDOM('https://herman.bearblog.dev/blog/');
        foreach ($dom->find('.blog-posts li') as $li) {
            $a = $li->find('a', 0);
            $this->items[] = [
                'title' => $a->plaintext,
                'uri' => 'https://herman.bearblog.dev' . $a->href,
            ];
        }
    }
}
```

### How to enable all bridges

    enabled_bridges[] = *

### How to enable some bridges

```
enabled_bridges[] = TwitchBridge
enabled_bridges[] = GettrBridge
```

### How to enable debug mode

The 
[debug mode](https://rss-bridge.github.io/rss-bridge/For_Developers/Debug_mode.html)
disables the majority of caching operations.

    enable_debug_mode = true

### How to switch to memcached as cache backend

```
[cache]

; Cache backend: file (default), sqlite, memcached, null
type = "memcached"
```

### How to switch to sqlite3 as cache backend

    type = "sqlite"

### How to disable bridge errors (as feed items)

When a bridge fails, RSS-Bridge will produce a feed with a single item describing the error.

This way, feed readers pick it up and you are notified.

If you don't want this behaviour, switch the error output to `http`:

    [error]

    ; Defines how error messages are returned by RSS-Bridge
    ;
    ; "feed" = As part of the feed (default)
    ; "http" = As HTTP error message
    ; "none" = No errors are reported
    output = "http"

### How to accumulate errors before finally reporting it

Modify `report_limit` so that an error must occur 3 times before it is reported.

    ; Defines how often an error must occur before it is reported to the user
    report_limit = 3

The report count is reset to 0 each day.

### How to password-protect the instance (HTTP Basic Auth)

    [authentication]

    enable = true
    username = "alice"
    password = "cat"

Will typically require feed readers to be configured with the credentials.

It may also be possible to manually include the credentials in the URL:

https://alice:cat@rss-bridge.org/bridge01/?action=display&bridge=FabriceBellardBridge&format=Html

### How to create a new output format

See `formats/PlaintextFormat.php` for an example.

### How to run unit tests and linter

These commands require that you have installed the dev dependencies in `composer.json`.

    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
    ./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml --warning-severity=0 --extensions=php -p ./

### How to spawn a minimal development environment

    php -S 127.0.0.1:9001

http://127.0.0.1:9001/

## Explanation

We are RSS-Bridge community, a group of developers continuing the project initiated by sebsauvage,
webmaster of
[sebsauvage.net](https://sebsauvage.net), author of

See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)

RSS-Bridge uses caching to prevent services from banning your server for repeatedly updating feeds.
The specific cache duration can be different between bridges.
Cached files are deleted automatically after 24 hours.

RSS-Bridge allows you to take full control over which bridges are displayed to the user.
That way you can host your own RSS-Bridge service with your favorite collection of bridges!

Current maintainers (as of 2024): @dvikan and @Mynacol #2519

## Reference

### Feed item structure

This is the feed item structure that bridges are expected to produce.

```php
    $item = [
        'uri' => 'https://example.com/blog/hello',
        'title' => 'Hello world',
        // Publication date in unix timestamp
        'timestamp' => 1668706254,
        'author' => 'Alice',
        'content' => 'Here be item content',
        'enclosures' => [
            'https://example.com/foo.png',
            'https://example.com/bar.png'
        ],
        'categories' => [
            'news',
            'tech',
        ],
        // Globally unique id
        'uid' => 'e7147580c8747aad',
    ]
```

### Output formats

* `Atom`: Atom feed, for use in feed readers
* `Html`: Simple HTML page
* `Json`: JSON, for consumption by other applications
* `Mrss`: MRSS feed, for use in feed readers
* `Plaintext`: Raw text, for consumption by other applications
* `Sfeed`: Text, TAB separated

### Cache backends

* `File`
* `SQLite`
* `Memcached`
* `Array`
* `Null`

## Rant

*Dear so-called "social" websites.*

Your catchword is "share", but you don't want us to share. You want to keep us within your walled gardens. That's why you've been removing RSS links from webpages, hiding them deep on your website, or removed feeds entirely, replacing it with crippled or demented proprietary API. **FUCK YOU.**

You're not social when you hamper sharing by removing feeds. You're happy to have customers creating content for your ecosystem, but you don't want this content out - a content you do not even own. Google Takeout is just a gimmick. We want our data to flow, we want RSS or Atom feeds.

We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have *your* service with *your* applications using *your* API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.

We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

Get your shit together: Put RSS/Atom back in.
