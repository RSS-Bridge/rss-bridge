RSS-Bridge is a PHP project capable of generating RSS and Atom feeds for websites that don't have one. It can be used on webservers or as a stand-alone application in CLI mode.

**Important**: RSS-Bridge is __not__ a feed reader or feed aggregator, but a tool to generate feeds that are consumed by feed readers and feed aggregators. Find a list of feed aggregators on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators).

Enable / Disable bridges
===

RSS-Bridge allows you to take full control over which bridges are displayed to the user. That way you can host your own RSS-Bridge service with your favorite collection of bridges!

Find more information on the [Documentation](https://rss-bridge.github.io/rss-bridge/For_Hosts/Whitelisting.html)

**Notice**: By default, RSS-Bridge will only show a small subset of bridges. Make sure to read up on [whitelisting](https://rss-bridge.github.io/rss-bridge/For_Hosts/Whitelisting.html) to unlock the full potential of RSS-Bridge!

Technical notes
===

  * RSS-Bridge uses caching to prevent services from banning your server for repeatedly updating feeds. The specific cache duration can be different between bridges. Cached files are deleted automatically after 24 hours.
  * You can implement your own bridge, [following these instructions](https://rss-bridge.github.io/rss-bridge/Bridge_API/index.html).
  * You can enable debug mode to disable caching. Find more information on the [Wiki](https://rss-bridge.github.io/rss-bridge/For_Developers/Debug_mode.html)

Rant
===

*Dear so-called "social" websites.*

Your catchword is "share", but you don't want us to share. You want to keep us within your walled gardens. That's why you've been removing RSS links from webpages, hiding them deep on your website, or removed feeds entirely, replacing it with crippled or demented proprietary API. **FUCK YOU.**

You're not social when you hamper sharing by removing feeds. You're happy to have customers creating content for your ecosystem, but you don't want this content out - a content you do not even own. Google Takeout is just a gimmick. We want our data to flow, we want RSS or Atom feeds.

We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have *your* service with *your* applications using *your* API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.

We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

Get your shit together: Put RSS/Atom back in.
