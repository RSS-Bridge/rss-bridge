## How-to

### How to create a new bridge from scratch

Create the new bridge in e.g. `bridges/BearBlogBridge.php`:

```php
<?php

class BearBlogBridge extends BridgeAbstract
{
    const NAME = 'BearBlog (bearblog.dev)';

    public function collectData()
    {
        $dom = getSimpleHTMLDOM('https://herman.bearblog.dev/blog/');
        foreach ($dom->find('.blog-posts li') as $li) {
            $a = $li->find('a', 0);
            $this->items[] = [
                'title' => $a->plaintext,
                'uri' => 'https://herman.bearblog.dev' . $a->href,
            ];
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation

We are RSS-Bridge community, a group of developers continuing the project initiated by sebsauvage,

See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md)

RSS-Bridge uses caching to prevent services from banning your server for repeatedly updating feeds.
The specific cache duration can be different between bridges. Cached files are deleted automatically after 24 hours.

RSS-Bridge allows you to take full control over which bridges are displayed to the user.
That way you can host your own RSS-Bridge service with your favorite collection of bridges!


## Reference

### FeedItem properties

```php
    $item = [
        'uri' => 'https://example.com/blog/hello',
        'title' => 'Hello world',
        // Publication date in unix timestamp
        'timestamp' => 1668706254,
        'author' => 'Alice',
        'content' => 'Here be item content',
        'enclosures' => [
            'https://example.com/foo.png',
            'https://example.com/bar.png'
        ],
        'categories' => [
            'news',
            'tech',
        ],
        // Globally unique id
        'uid' => 'e7147580c8747aad',
    ]
```

### Output formats:

* `Atom` : Atom feed, for use in feed readers
* `Html` : Simple HTML page

## Rant

*Dear so-called "social" websites.*

Your catchword is "share", but you don't want us to share. You want to keep us within your walled gardens. That's why you've been removing RSS links from webpages, hiding them deep on your website, or removed feeds entirely, replacing it with crippled or demented proprietary API. **FUCK YOU.**

You're not social when you hamper sharing by removing feeds. You're happy to have customers creating content for your ecosystem, but you don't want this content out - a content you do not even own. Google Takeout is just a gimmick. We want our data to flow, we want RSS or Atom feeds.

We want to share with friends, using open protocols: RSS, Atom, XMPP, whatever. Because no one wants to have *your* service with *your* applications using *your* API force-feeding them. Friends must be free to choose whatever software and service they want.

We are rebuilding bridges you have willfully destroyed.

Get your shit together: Put RSS/Atom back in.
