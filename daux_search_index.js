Please check this page before opening a new Issue :revolving_hearts: Why doesn\u2019t my bridge show new contents? How can I make a bridge update more frequently? Firefox doesn\u2019t show feeds anymore, what can I do? #Why doesn\u2019t my bridge show new contents? RSS-Bridge creates a cached version of your feed in order to reduce traffic and respond faster. The cached version is created on the first request and served for all subsequent requests. On every request RSS-Bridge checks if the cache timeout has elapsed. If the timeout has elapsed, it loads new contents and updates the cached version. Notice: RSS-Bridge only updates feeds if you actively request it, for example by pressing F5 in your browser or using a feed reader. The cache duration is bridge specific and can last anywhere between five minutes and 24 hours. You can specify a custom cache timeout for each bridge if this option has been enabled on the server. #How can I make a bridge update more frequently? You can only do that if you are hosting the RSS-Bridge instance: Enable custom_timeout Alternatively, change the default timeout for your bridge by modifying the CACHE_TIMEOUT constant in the relevant bridge file (e.g here for the Filter Bridge). #Firefox doesn\u2019t show feeds anymore, what can I do? As of version 64, Firefox removed support for viewing Atom and RSS feeds in the browser. This results in the browser downloading the pages instead of showing contents.

Some bridges could be implemented more efficiently by actually using proprietary APIs, but there are reasons against it: RSS-Bridge exists in the first place to NOT use APIs.

Enable HTTPS on your server to ensure your connection is encrypted and secure! #.htaccess .htaccess files are commonly used to restrict access to files on a web server. One of the features of .htaccess files is the ability to password protect specific (or all) directories. If setup correctly, a password is required to access the files. The usage of .htaccess files requires three basic steps: Enable .htaccess Create a .htpasswd file Create a .htaccess file #Enable .htaccess This process depends on the server you are using. Some providers may require you to change some settings, or place\/change some file. Here are some helpful links for your server (please add your own if missing :sparkling_heart:) Apache: http:\/\/ask.xmodulo.com\/enable-htaccess-apache.html #Create a .htpasswd file The .htpasswd file contains the user name and password used for login to your web server. Please notice that the password is stored in encrypted form, which requires you to encrypt your password before creating the .htpasswd file! Here are three ways of creating your own .htpasswd file: 1) Example file Example .htpasswd file (user name: \u201ctest\u201d, password: \u201ctest\u201d): test:$apr1$a52u9ILP$XTNG8qMJiEXSm1zD0lQcR0 Just copy and paste the contents to your .htpasswd file. 2) Online generator (read warning!) You can create your own .htpasswd file online using a .htpasswd generator like this: https:\/\/www.htaccesstools.com\/htpasswd-generator\/ WARNING! Never insert real passwords to an online generator! 3) Generate your own password Another way to create your own .htpasswd file is to run this script on your server (it\u2019ll output the data for you, you just have to paste it int a .htpasswd file): &lt;?php \/\/ Password to be encrypted for a .htpasswd file $clearTextPassword = 'some password'; \/\/ Encrypt password $password = crypt($clearTextPassword, base64_encode($clearTextPassword)); \/\/ Print encrypted password echo $password; ?&gt; source: https:\/\/www.htaccesstools.com\/articles\/create-password-for-htpasswd-file-using-php\/ #Create a .htaccess file The .htaccess file is used to specify which directories are password protected. For that purpose you should place the file in whatever directory you want to restrict access. If you want to restrict access to RSS-Bridge in general, you should place the file in the root directory (where index.php is located). Two parameters must be specified in the .htaccess file: AuthName AuthUserFile AuthName specifies the name of the authentication (i.e. \u201cRSS-Bridge\u201d). AuthUserFile defines the absolute path to a .htpasswd file. Here are two ways of creating your own .htaccess file: 1) Example file AuthType Basic AuthName &quot;My Protected Area&quot; AuthUserFile \/path\/to\/.htpasswd Require valid-user Notice: You must change the AuthUserFile location to fit your own server (i.e. \/var\/www\/html\/rss-bridge\/.htpasswd) 2) Online generator You can use an online generator to create the file for you and copy-paste it to your .htaccess file: https:\/\/www.htaccesstools.com\/htaccess-authentication\/ #RSS-Bridge Authentication RSS-Bridge ships with an authentication module designed for single user environments.

It requires additional parameter, some of which are specific to each bridge (see implementation details for your specific bridge). The following list contains mandatory parameter applicable to all bridges, excluding parameters that require additional options. Errors are returned for missing mandatory parameters: Parameter Required Description bridge yes Specifies the name of the bridge to display. Possible values are determined from the bridges available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge and the whitelist. format yes Specifies the name of the format to use for displaying the feed. Possible values are determined from the formats available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge. #Detect The detect action attempts to redirect the user to an appropriate display action for a feed based on a supplied URL. As bridges have to individually implement this it may not work for every bridge. If an appropriate bridge is found, a 301 Moved Permanently HTTP status code is returned with a relative location for a display action. If no appropriate bridge is found or a required parameter is missing, a 400 Bad Request status code is returned. The parameters for this action are listed below: Parameter Required Description url yes Specifies the URL to attempt to find a feed from. The value of this should be URL encoded. format yes Specifies the name of the format to use for displaying the feed. This is passed to the detected display action. Possible values are determined from the formats available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge. #List The list action returns a JSON formatted text containing information on all bridges available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge. Inactive bridges (not whitelisted) are included as well. Broken bridges are also included, but with limited parameters (only &quot;status&quot;: &quot;inactive&quot;). This example shows JSON data for a single bridge: { &quot;bridges&quot;: { &quot;ABCTabs&quot;: { &quot;status&quot;: &quot;active&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;: &quot;https:\\\/\\\/www.abc-tabs.com\\\/&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ABC Tabs Bridge&quot;, &quot;parameters&quot;: [], &quot;maintainer&quot;: &quot;kranack&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Returns 22 newest tabs&quot; } }, &quot;total&quot;: 1 } The top-level JSON object contains two parameters: bridges: A collection of bridges total: The total number of bridges { &quot;bridges&quot;: { }, &quot;total&quot;: 0 } #bridges The bridges parameter is a collection of bridge objects. The name of each object represents the name of the bridge as needed for the display action. Each object contains parameters, most of which are optional. The following table summarizes the parameters: Parameter Optional Description status No Indicates the status of the bridge. Possible values are \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018inactive\u2019. Only active bridges can be used for the display action. uri Yes Returns the URI of the bridge, as returned by the getURI function of the bridge. name Yes Returns the name of the bridge, as returned by the getName function of the bridge. parameters Yes Returns the PARAMETERS object of the bridge maintainer Yes Returns the name(s) of maintainer(s) for the bridge description Yes Returns the description of the bridge #total This parameter represents the total number of bridges available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge. #FindFeed The findfeed action attempts to list all available feeds based on a supplied URL for the active bridges of this instance. As bridges have to individually implement detectParameters, this it may not work for every bridge. If one or more bridges return a feed, a JSON data array structure is returned. If no feeds were found, a 404 Not Found status code is returned. If a required parameter is missing, a 400 Bad Request status code is returned. For each feed, the whole feed URL is sent in the url member, the feed specific bridge parameters metadata in the bridgeData member and the Bridge metadata in the bridgeMeta member. This example shows JSON data for the NASA Instagram account URL (https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nasa\/) using the Html format : [ { &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https:\/\/rssbridge.host\/?action=display&amp;context=Username&amp;u=nasa&amp;bridge=InstagramBridge&amp;format=Html&quot;, &quot;bridgeParams&quot;: { &quot;context&quot;: &quot;Username&quot;, &quot;u&quot;: &quot;nasa&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;: &quot;InstagramBridge&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;Html&quot; }, &quot;bridgeData&quot;: { &quot;context&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Context&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Username&quot; }, &quot;u&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;username&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;nasa&quot; } }, &quot;bridgeMeta&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Instagram Bridge&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Returns the newest images&quot;, &quot;parameters&quot;: { &quot;Username&quot;: { &quot;u&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;username&quot;, &quot;exampleValue&quot;: &quot;aesoprockwins&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true } }, &quot;Hashtag&quot;: { &quot;h&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;hashtag&quot;, &quot;exampleValue&quot;: &quot;beautifulday&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true } }, &quot;Location&quot;: { &quot;l&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;location&quot;, &quot;exampleValue&quot;: &quot;london&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true } }, &quot;global&quot;: { &quot;media_type&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Media type&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;list&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: false, &quot;values&quot;: { &quot;All&quot;: &quot;all&quot;, &quot;Video&quot;: &quot;video&quot;, &quot;Picture&quot;: &quot;picture&quot;, &quot;Multiple&quot;: &quot;multiple&quot; }, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;all&quot; }, &quot;direct_links&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Use direct media links&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;checkbox&quot; } } }, &quot;icon&quot;: &quot;https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/\/favicon.ico&quot; } } ] The parameters for this action are listed below: Parameter Required Description url yes Specifies the URL to attempt to find a feed from.

At the end of this document you\u2019ll find a complete template based on these instructions. The pictures below show an example based on these instructions: Show pictures Make sure to read these instructions carefully. Please don\u2019t hesitate to open an Issue if you have further questions (or suggestions). Once your bridge is finished, please open a Pull Request, in order to get your bridge merge into RSS-Bridge. #Step 1 - Create a new file Please read these instructions on how to create a new file for RSS-Bridge. #Step 2 - Add a class, extending BridgeAbstract Your bridge needs to be a class, which extends BridgeAbstract. The class name must exactly match the name of the file, without the file extension. For example: MyBridge.php =&gt; MyBridge Show example &lt;?PHP class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { } \/\/ This line is empty (just imagine it!) #Step 3 - Add general constants to the class In order to present your bridge on the front page, RSS-Bridge requires a few constants: const NAME \/\/ Name of the Bridge (default: &quot;Unnamed Bridge&quot;) const URI \/\/ URI to the target website of the bridge (default: empty) const DESCRIPTION \/\/ A brief description of the Bridge (default: &quot;No description provided&quot;) const MAINTAINER \/\/ Name of the maintainer, i.e. your name on GitHub (default: &quot;No maintainer&quot;) const PARAMETERS \/\/ (optional) Definition of additional parameters (default: empty) const CACHE_TIMEOUT \/\/ (optional) Defines the maximum duration for the cache in seconds (default: 3600) Show example &lt;?PHP class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { const NAME = 'My Bridge'; const URI = 'https:\/\/rss-bridge.github.io\/rss-bridge\/Bridge_API\/BridgeAbstract.html'; const DESCRIPTION = 'Returns &quot;Hello World!&quot;'; const MAINTAINER = 'ghost'; } \/\/ This line is empty (just imagine it!) Notice: const PARAMETERS can be used to request information from the user. Refer to these instructions for more information. #Step 4 - Implement a function to collect feed data In order for RSS-Bridge to collect data, you must implement the public function collectData. This function takes no arguments and returns nothing. It generates a list of feed elements, which must be placed into the variable $this-&gt;items. Show example &lt;?PHP class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { const NAME = 'My Bridge'; const URI = 'https:\/\/rss-bridge.github.io\/rss-bridge\/Bridge_API\/BridgeAbstract.html'; const DESCRIPTION = 'Returns &quot;Hello World!&quot;'; const MAINTAINER = 'ghost'; public function collectData() { $item = array(); \/\/ Create an empty item $item['title'] = 'Hello World!'; $this-&gt;items[] = $item; \/\/ Add item to the list } } \/\/ This line is empty (just imagine it!)

Show example const PARAMETERS = array( 'My Context 1' =&gt; array(), 'My Context 2' =&gt; array() ); Output Notice: The name of a context can be left empty if only one context is needed! Show example const PARAMETERS = array( array() ); You can also define a set of parameters that will be applied to every possible context of your bridge. To do this, specify a context named global. Show example const PARAMETERS = array( 'global' =&gt; array() \/\/ Applies to all contexts! ); #Level 2 - Parameter Parameters are placed inside a context. They are defined as associative array of parameter specifications. Each parameter is defined by it\u2019s internal input name, a definition in the form 'n' =&gt; array();, where n is the name with which the bridge can access the parameter during execution. Show example const PARAMETERS = array( 'My Context' =&gt; array( 'n' =&gt; array() ) ); The parameter specification consists of various fields, listed in the table below. Show example const PARAMETERS = array( 'My Context' =&gt; array( 'n' =&gt; array( 'name' =&gt; 'Limit', 'type' =&gt; 'number', 'required' =&gt; false, 'title' =&gt; 'Maximum number of items to return', 'defaultValue' =&gt; 10 ) ) ); Output Parameter Name Required Type Supported values Description name yes Text Input name as displayed to the user type no Text text, number, list, checkbox Type of the input (default: text) required no Boolean true, false Specifies if the parameter is required or not (default: false). Not supported for lists and checkboxes. values no associative array name\/value pairs used by the HTML option tag, required for type \u2018list\u2019 title no Text Used as tool-tip when mouse-hovering over the input box pattern no Text Defines a pattern for an element of type text. The pattern should be mentioned in the title attribute! exampleValue no Text Defines an example value displayed for elements of type text and number when no data has been entered yet defaultValue no Defines the default value if left blank by the user #List values List values are defined in an associative array where keys are the string displayed in the combo list of the RSS-Bridge web interface, and values are the content of the &lt;option&gt; HTML tag value attribute. ... 'type' =&gt; 'list', 'values' =&gt; array( 'Item A' =&gt; 'itemA' 'Item B' =&gt; 'itemB' ) ... If a more complex organization is required to display the values, the above key\/value can be used to set a title as a key and another array as a value: ... 'type' =&gt; 'list', 'values' =&gt; array( 'Item A' =&gt; 'itemA', 'List 1' =&gt; array( 'Item C' =&gt; 'itemC', 'Item D' =&gt; 'itemD' ), 'List 2' =&gt; array( 'Item E' =&gt; 'itemE', 'Item F' =&gt; 'itemF' ), 'Item B' =&gt; 'itemB' ) ... #defaultValue This attribute defines the default value for your parameter.

If you are unsure how to solve a specific problem, please don\u2019t hesitate to open an Issue on GitHub. Existing bridges are also a good source to learn implementing your own bridge. #Implementing the collectData function Implementation for the collectData function is specific to each bridge. However, there are certain reoccurring elements, described below. RSS-Bridge also provides functions to simplify the process of collecting and parsing HTML data (see \u201cHelper Functions\u201d on the sidebar) Elements collected by this function must be stored in $this-&gt;items. The items variable is an array of item elements, each of which is an associative array that may contain arbitrary keys. RSS-Bridge specifies common keys which are used to generate most common feed formats. Show example $item = array(); \/\/ Create a new item $item['title'] = 'Hello World!'; $this-&gt;items[] = $item; \/\/ Add item to the list Additional keys may be added for custom APIs (ignored by RSS-Bridge). #Item parameters The item array should provide as much information as possible for RSS-Bridge to generate feature rich feeds. Find below list of keys supported by RSS-Bridge. $item['uri'] \/\/ URI to reach the subject (&quot;https:\/\/...&quot;) $item['title'] \/\/ Title of the item $item['timestamp'] \/\/ Timestamp of the item in numeric or text format (compatible for strtotime()) $item['author'] \/\/ Name of the author for this item $item['content'] \/\/ Content in HTML format $item['enclosures'] \/\/ Array of URIs to an attachments (pictures, files, etc...) $item['categories'] \/\/ Array of categories \/ tags \/ topics $item['uid'] \/\/ A unique ID to identify the current item All formats support these parameters. The formats Plaintext and JSON also support custom parameters. #getDescription The getDescription function returns the description for a bridge. Notice: By default RSS-Bridge returns the contents of const DESCRIPTION, so you only have to implement this function if you require different behavior! public function getDescription(){ return self::DESCRIPTION; } #getMaintainer The getMaintainer function returns the name of the maintainer for a bridge.

'\/favicon.ico'; } #detectParameters The detectParameters function takes a URL and attempts to extract a valid set of parameters for the current bridge. If the passed URL is valid for this bridge the function should return an array of parameter -&gt; value pairs that can be used by this bridge, or an empty array if the bridge requires no parameters. If the URL is not relevant for this bridge the function should return null. Notice: Implementing this function is optional. By default RSS-Bridge tries to match the supplied URL to the URI constant defined in the bridge which may be enough for bridges without any parameters defined. public function detectParameters($url){ $regex = '\/^(https?:\\\/\\\/)?(www\\.)?(.+?)(\\\/)?$\/'; if(empty(static::PARAMETERS) &amp;&amp; preg_match($regex, $url, $urlMatches) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; preg_match($regex, static::URI, $bridgeUriMatches) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; $urlMatches[3] === $bridgeUriMatches[3]) { return array(); } else { return null; } } #Helper Methods BridgeAbstract implements helper methods to make it easier for bridge maintainers to create bridges.

Enter an XPath expression matching a list of dom nodes, each node containing one feed article item in total (usually a surrounding &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; tag). This will be the context nodes for all of the following expressions. This expression usually starts with a single forward slash. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TITLE XPath expression for extracting an item title from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article headline. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_CONTENT XPath expression for extracting an item\u2019s content from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article content or description. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_URI XPath expression for extracting an item link from the item context. This expression should match a node\u2019s attribute containing the article URL (usually the href attribute of an &lt;a&gt; tag). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_AUTHOR XPath expression for extracting an item author from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article author\u2019s name. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TIMESTAMP XPath expression for extracting an item timestamp from the item context. This expression should match a node or node\u2019s attribute containing the article timestamp or date (parsable by PHP\u2019s strtotime function). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_ENCLOSURES XPath expression for extracting item enclosures (media content like images or movies) from the item context. This expression should match a node\u2019s attribute containing an article image URL (usually the src attribute of an tag or a style attribute). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_CATEGORIES XPath expression for extracting an item category from the item context. This expression should match a node or node\u2019s attribute contained within each article item node containing the article category. This could be inside or tags or sometimes be hidden in a data attribute. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant SETTING_FIX_ENCODING Turns on automatic fixing of encoding errors. Set this to true for fixing feed encoding by invoking PHP\u2019s utf8_decode function on all extracted texts. Try this in case you see \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d characters in your feed where you\u2019d normally expect umlauts or any other non-ascii characters. #Optional methods XPathAbstract offers a set of methods which can be overridden by derived classes for fine tuning and customization. This is optional. The methods provided for overriding can be grouped into three categories. #Methods for providing XPath expressions Usually XPath expressions are defined in the class constants described above. By default the following base methods just return the value of its corresponding class constant. However deriving classed can override them in case if XPath expressions need to be formed dynamically or based on conditions. In case any of these methods is defined, the method\u2019s return value is used instead of the corresponding constant for providing the value. #Method getSourceUrl() Should return the source Web page URL used as a base for applying the XPath expressions. #Method getExpressionTitle() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed title from the source page. #Method getExpressionIcon() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed favicon from the source page. #Method getExpressionItem() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed items from the source page. #Method getExpressionItemTitle() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item title from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemContent() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item\u2019s content from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemUri() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item link from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemAuthor() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item author from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemTimestamp() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item timestamp from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemEnclosures() Should return the XPath expression for extracting item enclosures (media content like images or movies) from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemCategories() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item category from the item context. #Method getSettingFixEncoding() Should return the Fix encoding setting value (bool true or false). #Methods for providing feed data Those methods are invoked for providing the HTML source as a base for applying the XPath expressions as well as feed meta data as the title and icon. #Method provideWebsiteContent() This method should return the HTML source as a base for the XPath expressions. Usually it merely returns the HTML content of the URL specified in the constant FEED_SOURCE_URL retrieved by curl. Some sites however require user authentication mechanisms, the use of special cookies and\/or headers, where the direct retrival using standard curl would not suffice. In that case this method should be overridden and take care of the page retrival. #Method provideFeedTitle() This method should provide the feed title. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_TITLE is used for extracting the title directly from the page source. #Method provideFeedIcon() This method should provide the feed title. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_ICON is used for extracting the title directly from the page source. #Method provideFeedItems() This method should provide the feed items. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM is used for extracting the items from the page source. All other XPath expressions are applied on a per-item basis, item by item, and only on the item\u2019s contents. #Methods for formatting and filtering feed item attributes The following methods are invoked after extraction of the feed items from the source. Each of them expect one parameter, the value of the corresponding field, which then can be processed and transformed by the method. You can override these methods in order to format or filter parts of the feed output. #Method formatItemTitle() Accepts the items title values as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemContent() Accepts the items content as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemUri() Accepts the items link URL as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemAuthor() Accepts the items author as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemTimestamp() Accepts the items creation timestamp as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a unix timestamp as integer. #Method cleanImageUrl() Method invoked for cleaning feed icon and item image URL\u2019s. Extracts the image URL from the passed parameter, stripping any additional content. Furthermore makes sure that relative image URL\u2019s get transformed to absolute ones. #Method fixEncoding() Only invoked when class constant SETTING_FIX_ENCODING is set to true. It then passes all extracted string values through PHP\u2019s utf8_decode function. #Method generateItemId() This method plays in important role for generating feed item ids for all extracted items. Every feed item needs an unique identifier (Uid), so that your feed reader updates the original item instead of adding a duplicate in case an items content is updated on the source site. Usually the items link URL is a good candidate the the Uid. #Template Use this template to create your own bridge. Please remove any unnecessary comments and parameters. &lt;?php class TestBridge extends XPathAbstract { const NAME = 'Test'; const URI = 'https:\/\/www.unbemerkt.eu\/de\/blog\/'; const DESCRIPTION = 'Test'; const MAINTAINER = 'your name'; const CACHE_TIMEOUT = 3600; const FEED_SOURCE_URL = 'https:\/\/www.unbemerkt.eu\/de\/blog\/'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM = '\/html[1]\/body[1]\/section[1]\/section[1]\/div[1]\/div[1]\/div[1]\/div[1]\/div[1]\/div[*]\/article[1]'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TITLE = '.\/\/a[@target=&quot;_self&quot;]'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_CONTENT = '.\/\/div[@class=&quot;post-content&quot;]'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_URI = '.\/\/a[@class=&quot;more-btn&quot;]\/@href'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_AUTHOR = '\/html[1]\/body[1]\/section[1]\/div[2]\/div[1]\/div[1]\/h1[1]'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TIMESTAMP = '.\/\/time\/@datetime'; const XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_ENCLOSURES = '.\/\/img\/@data-src'; const SETTING_FIX_ENCODING = false; }","tags":"","url":"Bridge_API\/XPathAbstract.html"},{"title":"Helper functions","text":"#getInput The getInput function is used to receive a value for a parameter, specified in const PARAMETERS $this-&gt;getInput('your input name here'); getInput will either return the value for your parameter or null if the parameter is unknown or not specified. #getKey The getKey function is used to receive the key name to a selected list value given the name of the list, specified in const PARAMETERS Is able to work with multidimensional list arrays. \/\/ Given a multidimensional array like this const PARAMETERS = [[ 'country' =&gt; [ 'name' =&gt; 'Country', 'type' =&gt; 'list', 'values' =&gt; [ 'North America' =&gt; [ 'Mexico' =&gt; 'mx', 'United States' =&gt; 'us' ], 'South America' =&gt; [ 'Uruguay' =&gt; 'uy', 'Venezuela' =&gt; 've' ], ] ] ]], \/\/ Provide the list name to the function $this-&gt;getKey('country'); \/\/ if the selected value was &quot;ve&quot;, this function will return &quot;Venezuela&quot; getKey will either return the key name for your parameter or null if the parameter is unknown or not specified. #getContents The getContents function uses cURL to acquire data from the specified URI while respecting the various settings defined at a global level by RSS-Bridge (i.e., proxy host, user agent, etc.).
