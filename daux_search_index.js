RSS-Bridge creates a cached version of your feed in order to reduce traffic and respond faster. The cached version is created on the first request and served for all subsequent requests. On every request RSS-Bridge checks if the cache timeout has elapsed. If the timeout has elapsed, it loads new contents and updates the cached version. Notice: RSS-Bridge only updates feeds if you actively request it, for example by pressing F5 in your browser or using a feed reader. The cache duration is bridge specific (usually 1h) You can specify a custom cache timeout for each bridge if this option has been enabled on the server. #How can I make a bridge update more frequently? You can only do that if you are hosting the RSS-Bridge instance: Lower the bridge ttl: CACHE_TIMEOUT constant Enable custom_timeout #Firefox doesn\u2019t show feeds anymore, what can I do? As of version 64, Firefox removed support for viewing Atom and RSS feeds in the browser. This results in the browser downloading the pages instead of showing contents.

RSS-Bridge comes with a large amount of bridges. Some bridges could be implemented more efficiently by actually using proprietary APIs, but there are reasons against it: RSS-Bridge exists in the first place to NOT use APIs. See the rant. APIs require private keys that could be stored on servers running RSS-Bridge, which is a security concern, involves complex authorizations for inexperienced users and could cause harm (when using paid services for example). In a closed environment (a server only you use for yourself) however you might be interested in using them anyway.

Possible values are determined from the bridges available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge and the whitelist. format yes Specifies the name of the format to use for displaying the feed. Possible values are determined from the formats available to the current instance of RSS-Bridge. #Detect The detect action attempts to redirect the user to an appropriate display action for a feed based on a supplied URL. As bridges have to individually implement this it may not work for every bridge. If an appropriate bridge is found, a 301 Moved Permanently HTTP status code is returned with a relative location for a display action.

As bridges have to individually implement detectParameters, this it may not work for every bridge. If one or more bridges return a feed, a JSON data array structure is returned. If no feeds were found, a 404 Not Found status code is returned. If a required parameter is missing, a 400 Bad Request status code is returned.

It implements the most common functions to simplify the process of adding new bridges. #Creating a new bridge You need four basic steps in order to create a new bridge: Step 1 - Create a new file Step 2 - Add a class, extending BridgeAbstract Step 3 - Add general constants to the class Step 4 - Implement a function to collect feed data These steps are described in more detail below. At the end of this document you\u2019ll find a complete template based on these instructions. The pictures below show an example based on these instructions: Show pictures Make sure to read these instructions carefully. Please don\u2019t hesitate to open an Issue if you have further questions (or suggestions). Once your bridge is finished, please open a Pull Request, in order to get your bridge merge into RSS-Bridge. #Step 1 - Create a new file Please read these instructions on how to create a new file for RSS-Bridge. #Step 2 - Add a class, extending BridgeAbstract Your bridge needs to be a class, which extends BridgeAbstract. The class name must exactly match the name of the file, without the file extension. For example: MyBridge.php =&gt; MyBridge Show example &lt;?PHP class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { } #Step 3 - Add general constants to the class In order to present your bridge on the front page, RSS-Bridge requires a few constants: const NAME \/\/ Name of the Bridge (default: &quot;Unnamed Bridge&quot;) const URI \/\/ URI to the target website of the bridge (default: empty) const DESCRIPTION \/\/ A brief description of the Bridge (default: &quot;No description provided&quot;) const MAINTAINER \/\/ Name of the maintainer, i.e. your name on GitHub (default: &quot;No maintainer&quot;) const PARAMETERS \/\/ (optional) Definition of additional parameters (default: empty) const CACHE_TIMEOUT \/\/ (optional) Defines the maximum duration for the cache in seconds (default: 3600) Show example &lt;?php class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { const NAME = 'My Bridge'; const URI = 'https:\/\/rss-bridge.github.io\/rss-bridge\/Bridge_API\/BridgeAbstract.html'; const DESCRIPTION = 'Returns &quot;Hello World!&quot;'; const MAINTAINER = 'ghost'; } Notice: const PARAMETERS can be used to request information from the user. Refer to these instructions for more information. #Step 4 - Implement a function to collect feed data In order for RSS-Bridge to collect data, you must implement the public function collectData. This function takes no arguments and returns nothing. It generates a list of feed elements, which must be placed into the variable $this-&gt;items. Show example &lt;?php class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { const NAME = 'My Bridge'; const URI = 'https:\/\/rss-bridge.github.io\/rss-bridge\/Bridge_API\/BridgeAbstract.html'; const DESCRIPTION = 'Returns &quot;Hello World!&quot;'; const MAINTAINER = 'ghost'; public function collectData() { $item = []; $item['title'] = 'Hello World!'; $this-&gt;items[] = $item; } } For more details on the collectData function refer to these instructions. #Template Use this template to create your own bridge. Please remove any unnecessary comments and parameters. &lt;?php class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { const NAME = 'Unnamed bridge'; const URI = ''; const DESCRIPTION = 'No description provided'; const MAINTAINER = 'No maintainer'; const PARAMETERS = []; \/\/ Can be omitted! const CACHE_TIMEOUT = 3600; \/\/ Can be omitted! public function collectData() { $item = []; \/\/ Create an empty item $item['title'] = 'Hello World!'; $this-&gt;items[] = $item; \/\/ Add item to the list } } #PARAMETERS You can specify additional parameters in order to customize the bridge (i.e. to specify how many items to return). This document explains how to specify those parameters and which options are available to you. For information on how to read parameter values during execution, please refer to the getInput function. #Adding parameters to a bridge Parameters are specified as part of the bridge class. An empty list of parameters is defined as const PARAMETERS = []; Show example &lt;?php class MyBridge extends BridgeAbstract { \/* ... *\/ const PARAMETERS = []; \/\/ Empty list of parameters (can be omitted) \/* ... *\/ } Parameters are organized in two levels: Level 1 - Context Level 2 - Parameter #Level 1 - Context A context is defined as a associative array of parameters. The name of a context is displayed by RSS-Bridge. Show example const PARAMETERS = [ 'My Context 1' =&gt; [], 'My Context 2' =&gt; [], ]; Output Notice: The name of a context can be left empty if only one context is needed! Show example const PARAMETERS = [ [] ]; You can also define a set of parameters that will be applied to every possible context of your bridge. To do this, specify a context named global. Show example const PARAMETERS = [ 'global' =&gt; [] \/\/ Applies to all contexts! ]; #Level 2 - Parameter Parameters are placed inside a context. They are defined as associative array of parameter specifications. Each parameter is defined by it\u2019s internal input name, a definition in the form 'n' =&gt; [];, where n is the name with which the bridge can access the parameter during execution. Show example const PARAMETERS = [ 'My Context' =&gt; [ 'n' =&gt; [], ] ]; The parameter specification consists of various fields, listed in the table below. Show example const PARAMETERS = [ 'My Context' =&gt; [ 'n' =&gt; [ 'name' =&gt; 'Limit', 'type' =&gt; 'number', 'required' =&gt; false, 'title' =&gt; 'Maximum number of items to return', 'defaultValue' =&gt; 10, ] ] ]; Output Parameter Name Required Type Supported values Description name yes Text Input name as displayed to the user type no Text text, number, list, checkbox Type of the input (default: text) required no Boolean true, false Specifies if the parameter is required or not (default: false). Not supported for lists and checkboxes. values no associative array name\/value pairs used by the HTML option tag, required for type \u2018list\u2019 title no Text Used as tool-tip when mouse-hovering over the input box pattern no Text Defines a pattern for an element of type text. The pattern should be mentioned in the title attribute! exampleValue no Text Defines an example value displayed for elements of type text and number when no data has been entered yet defaultValue no Defines the default value if left blank by the user #List values List values are defined in an associative array where keys are the string displayed in the combo list of the RSS-Bridge web interface, and values are the content of the &lt;option&gt; HTML tag value attribute. ... 'type' =&gt; 'list', 'values' =&gt; [ 'Item A' =&gt; 'itemA' 'Item B' =&gt; 'itemB' ] ... If a more complex organization is required to display the values, the above key\/value can be used to set a title as a key and another array as a value: ... 'type' =&gt; 'list', 'values' =&gt; [ 'Item A' =&gt; 'itemA', 'List 1' =&gt; [ 'Item C' =&gt; 'itemC', 'Item D' =&gt; 'itemD' ], 'List 2' =&gt; [ 'Item E' =&gt; 'itemE', 'Item F' =&gt; 'itemF' ], 'Item B' =&gt; 'itemB' ] ... #defaultValue This attribute defines the default value for your parameter. Its behavior depends on the type: text: Allows any text number: Allows any number list: Must match either name or value of one element checkbox: Must be \u201cchecked\u201d to activate the checkbox #queriedContext The queried context is defined via PARAMETERS and can be accessed via $this-&gt;queriedContext. It provides a way to identify which context the bridge is called with. Example: const PARAMETERS = [ 'By user name' =&gt; [ 'u' =&gt; ['name' =&gt; 'Username'] ], 'By user ID' =&gt; [ 'id' =&gt; ['name' =&gt; 'User ID'] ] ]; In this example $this-&gt;queriedContext will either return By user name or By user ID. The queried context might return no value, so the best way to handle it is by using a case-structure: switch($this-&gt;queriedContext){ case 'By user name': break; case 'By user ID': break; default: \/\/ Return default value } #collectData The collectData function is responsible for collecting data and adding items to generate feeds from. If you are unsure how to solve a specific problem, please don\u2019t hesitate to open an Issue on GitHub. Existing bridges are also a good source to learn implementing your own bridge. #Implementing the collectData function Implementation for the collectData function is specific to each bridge. However, there are certain reoccurring elements, described below. RSS-Bridge also provides functions to simplify the process of collecting and parsing HTML data (see \u201cHelper Functions\u201d on the sidebar) Elements collected by this function must be stored in $this-&gt;items. The items variable is an array of item elements, each of which is an associative array that may contain arbitrary keys. RSS-Bridge specifies common keys which are used to generate most common feed formats. Show example $item = []; $item['title'] = 'Hello World!'; $this-&gt;items[] = $item; Additional keys may be added for custom APIs (ignored by RSS-Bridge). #Item parameters The item array should provide as much information as possible for RSS-Bridge to generate feature rich feeds. Find below list of keys supported by RSS-Bridge. $item['uri'] \/\/ URI to reach the subject (&quot;https:\/\/...&quot;) $item['title'] \/\/ Title of the item $item['timestamp'] \/\/ Timestamp of the item in numeric or text format (compatible for strtotime()) $item['author'] \/\/ Name of the author for this item $item['content'] \/\/ Content in HTML format $item['enclosures'] \/\/ Array of URIs to an attachments (pictures, files, etc...) $item['categories'] \/\/ Array of categories \/ tags \/ topics $item['uid'] \/\/ A unique ID to identify the current item All formats support these parameters. The formats Plaintext and JSON also support custom parameters. #getDescription The getDescription function returns the description for a bridge. Notice: By default RSS-Bridge returns the contents of const DESCRIPTION, so you only have to implement this function if you require different behavior! public function getDescription() { return self::DESCRIPTION; } #getMaintainer The getMaintainer function returns the name of the maintainer for a bridge. Notice: By default RSS-Bridge returns const MAINTAINER, so you only have to implement this function if you require different behavior! public function getMaintainer() { return self::MAINTAINER; } #getName The getName function returns the name of a bridge. Notice: By default RSS-Bridge returns const NAME, so you only have to implement this function if you require different behavior! public function getName() { return self::NAME; } #getURI The getURI function returns the base URI for a bridge. Notice: By default RSS-Bridge returns const URI, so you only have to implement this function if you require different behavior! public function getURI() { return self::URI; } #getIcon The getIcon function returns the URI for an icon, used as favicon in feeds. If no icon is specified by the bridge, RSS-Bridge will use a default location: static::URI . '\/favicon.ico' (i.e. \u201chttps:\/\/github.com\/favicon.ico\u201d) which may or may not exist. public function getIcon() { return static::URI . '\/favicon.ico'; } #detectParameters The detectParameters function takes a URL and attempts to extract a valid set of parameters for the current bridge. If the passed URL is valid for this bridge, the function should return an array of parameter -&gt; value pairs that can be used by this bridge, including context if available, or an empty array if the bridge requires no parameters. If the URL is not relevant for this bridge, the function should return null. Notice: Implementing this function is optional. By default, RSS-Bridge tries to match the supplied URL to the URI constant defined in the bridge, which may be enough for bridges without any parameters defined. public function detectParameters($url) { $regex = '\/^(https?:\\\/\\\/)?(www\\.)?(.+?)(\\\/)?$\/'; if (empty(static::PARAMETERS) &amp;&amp; preg_match($regex, $url, $urlMatches) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; preg_match($regex, static::URI, $bridgeUriMatches) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; $urlMatches[3] === $bridgeUriMatches[3] ) { return []; } else { return null; } } Notice: This function is also used by the findFeed action. This action allows an user to get a list of all feeds corresponding to an URL. You can implement automated tests for the detectParameters function by adding the TEST_DETECT_PARAMETERS constant to your bridge class constant. TEST_DETECT_PARAMETERS is an array, with as key the URL passed to the detectParametersfunction and as value, the array of parameters returned by detectParameters const TEST_DETECT_PARAMETERS = [ 'https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/metaverse' =&gt; ['context' =&gt; 'Username', 'u' =&gt; 'metaverse'], 'https:\/\/instagram.com\/metaverse' =&gt; ['context' =&gt; 'Username', 'u' =&gt; 'metaverse'], 'http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/metaverse' =&gt; ['context' =&gt; 'Username', 'u' =&gt; 'metaverse'], ]; Notice: Adding this constant is optional. If the constant is not present, no automated test will be executed. #Helper Methods BridgeAbstract implements helper methods to make it easier for bridge maintainers to create bridges. Use these methods whenever possible instead of writing your own. #saveCacheValue Within the context of the current bridge, stores a value by key in the cache. The value can later be retrieved with loadCacheValue. protected function saveCacheValue($key, $value, $ttl = null) Example: public function collectData() { $this-&gt;saveCacheValue('my_key', 'my_value', 3600); \/\/ 1h } #loadCacheValue Within the context of the current bridge, loads a value by key from cache.

On a multi-user site, Selenium Grid should be used and the number of sessions should be adjusted to the number of processor cores. Finally, the config.ini.php file must be adjusted so that the WebDriver can find the Selenium server: [webdriver] selenium_server_url = &quot;http:\/\/localhost:4444&quot; #Development While you are programming a new bridge, it is easier to start a local WebDriver because then you can see what is happening and where the errors are.

At the end of this document you\u2019ll find a complete template based on these instructions. #Required constants To create a new Bridge based on XPathAbstract your inheriting class should specify a set of constants describing the feed and the XPath expressions. It is advised to override constants inherited from BridgeAbstract aswell. #Class constant FEED_SOURCE_URL Source Web page URL (should provide either HTML or XML content). You can specify any website URL which serves data suited for display in RSS feeds #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_TITLE XPath expression for extracting the feed title from the source page. If this is left blank or does not provide any data BridgeAbstract::getName() is used instead as the feed\u2019s title. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_ICON XPath expression for extracting the feed favicon URL from the source page. If this is left blank or does not provide any data BridgeAbstract::getIcon() is used instead as the feed\u2019s favicon URL. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM XPath expression for extracting the feed items from the source page. Enter an XPath expression matching a list of dom nodes, each node containing one feed article item in total (usually a surrounding &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; tag). This will be the context nodes for all of the following expressions. This expression usually starts with a single forward slash. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TITLE XPath expression for extracting an item title from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article headline. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_CONTENT XPath expression for extracting an item\u2019s content from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article content or description. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_URI XPath expression for extracting an item link from the item context. This expression should match a node\u2019s attribute containing the article URL (usually the href attribute of an &lt;a&gt; tag). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_AUTHOR XPath expression for extracting an item author from the item context. This expression should match a node contained within each article item node containing the article author\u2019s name. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_TIMESTAMP XPath expression for extracting an item timestamp from the item context. This expression should match a node or node\u2019s attribute containing the article timestamp or date (parsable by PHP\u2019s strtotime function). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_ENCLOSURES XPath expression for extracting item enclosures (media content like images or movies) from the item context. This expression should match a node\u2019s attribute containing an article image URL (usually the src attribute of an tag or a style attribute). It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM_CATEGORIES XPath expression for extracting an item category from the item context. This expression should match a node or node\u2019s attribute contained within each article item node containing the article category. This could be inside or tags or sometimes be hidden in a data attribute. It should start with a dot followed by two forward slashes, referring to any descendant nodes of the article item node. Attributes can be selected by prepending an @ char before the attributes name. #Class constant SETTING_FIX_ENCODING Turns on automatic fixing of encoding errors. Set this to true for fixing feed encoding by invoking PHP\u2019s utf8_decode function on all extracted texts. Try this in case you see \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d characters in your feed where you\u2019d normally expect umlauts or any other non-ascii characters. #Optional methods XPathAbstract offers a set of methods which can be overridden by derived classes for fine tuning and customization. This is optional. The methods provided for overriding can be grouped into three categories. #Methods for providing XPath expressions Usually XPath expressions are defined in the class constants described above. By default the following base methods just return the value of its corresponding class constant. However deriving classed can override them in case if XPath expressions need to be formed dynamically or based on conditions. In case any of these methods is defined, the method\u2019s return value is used instead of the corresponding constant for providing the value. #Method getSourceUrl() Should return the source Web page URL used as a base for applying the XPath expressions. #Method getExpressionTitle() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed title from the source page. #Method getExpressionIcon() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed favicon from the source page. #Method getExpressionItem() Should return the XPath expression for extracting the feed items from the source page. #Method getExpressionItemTitle() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item title from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemContent() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item\u2019s content from the item context. #Method getSettingUseRawItemContent() Should return the \u2018Use raw item content\u2019 setting value (bool true or false). #Method getExpressionItemUri() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item link from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemAuthor() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item author from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemTimestamp() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item timestamp from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemEnclosures() Should return the XPath expression for extracting item enclosures (media content like images or movies) from the item context. #Method getExpressionItemCategories() Should return the XPath expression for extracting an item category from the item context. #Method getSettingFixEncoding() Should return the Fix encoding setting value (bool true or false). #Methods for providing feed data Those methods are invoked for providing the HTML source as a base for applying the XPath expressions as well as feed meta data as the title and icon. #Method provideWebsiteContent() This method should return the HTML source as a base for the XPath expressions. Usually it merely returns the HTML content of the URL specified in the constant FEED_SOURCE_URL retrieved by curl. Some sites however require user authentication mechanisms, the use of special cookies and\/or headers, where the direct retrival using standard curl would not suffice. In that case this method should be overridden and take care of the page retrival. #Method provideFeedTitle() This method should provide the feed title. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_TITLE is used for extracting the title directly from the page source. #Method provideFeedIcon() This method should provide the URL of the feed\u2019s favicon. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_FEED_ICON is used for extracting the title directly from the page source. #Method provideFeedItems() This method should provide the feed items. Usually the XPath expression defined in XPATH_EXPRESSION_ITEM is used for extracting the items from the page source. All other XPath expressions are applied on a per-item basis, item by item, and only on the item\u2019s contents. #Methods for formatting and filtering feed item attributes The following methods are invoked after extraction of the feed items from the source. Each of them expect one parameter, the value of the corresponding field, which then can be processed and transformed by the method. You can override these methods in order to format or filter parts of the feed output. #Method formatItemTitle() Accepts the items title values as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemContent() Accepts the items content as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemUri() Accepts the items link URL as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemAuthor() Accepts the items author as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a string. #Method formatItemTimestamp() Accepts the items creation timestamp as parameter, processes and returns it. Should return a unix timestamp as integer. #Method cleanMediaUrl() Method invoked for cleaning feed icon, item image and media attachment (like .mp3, .webp) URL\u2019s. Extracts the media URL from the passed parameter, stripping any additional content.
